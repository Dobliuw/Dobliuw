### 🧬 About me

Hey! I'm O<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 0 0 5px red;">w</span>en (<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 0 0 8px red;">Dobliuw</span>) passionate about technology and a self-taught researcher focused on offensive cybersecurity. I currently work in the **Vulnerability Management department** at a prestigious company performing pentesting on client systems and custom development APKs, DAST and SAST analysis of these and web systems, and corresponding reporting. 

I started in the Blue Team area as a SOC Analyst (Level 1-2) and while I continue to delve deeper into the areas of ethical hacking, exploitation, reverse engineering, low-level development, and networks and security in these areas, electronics, and anything else that interests me to nerd out on (I fell in love with studying).

My driving force? The “<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 0 0 5px red;">Why behind the why</span>”.

- 📡 I study systems from the core to the most superficial application layer.
- 💣 I am developing my own tools and hardware devices for RF attacks, Bluetooth, Bad USBs, content disclosure, and tutorials and/or classes on cybersecurity, programming, operating systems, and their configuration at the sysadmin level.  
- 🧠 My interests revolve around understanding everything that others use and understanding and being the one who develops this myself.
